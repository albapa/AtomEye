Compilation
===========

You'll need to edit Makefile.config for your system, and then run
'make' to build a binary or 'make atomeyelib' to build a library.

See the 'Python' subdirectory for a Python extension module which
links to this library. Documentation for the Python interface is
available at <http://www.jrkermode.co.uk/quippy/atomeye.html>

QUIP users
==========

If you are a QUIP user, you should check out this module underneath
${QUIP_ROOT}/Tools, and set the QUIP_ARCH environment variable
appropriately. This will use your QUIP Makefiles to determine the
compiler, flags and libraries needed. You can then run 'make' or 'make
atomeyelib' as above.
