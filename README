Compilation
===========

You'll need to edit Makefile.config for your system, and then run
'make' to build a binary or 'make atomeyelib' to build a library.

See the 'Python' subdirectory for a Python extension module which
links to this library. Documentation for the Python interface is
available at <http://www.jrkermode.co.uk/quippy/atomeye.html>

If you want to compile both targets, it's very important that you do a
'make clean' in between building the standalone binary and the library.

QUIP users
==========

If you are a QUIP user, you should check out this module underneath
${QUIP_ROOT}/Tools, and set the QUIP_ARCH environment variable
appropriately. This will use your QUIP Makefiles to determine the
compiler, flags and libraries needed. You can then run 'make' or 'make
atomeyelib' as above.


Mac OS X Application
====================

To build a Mac OS X 'droplet' application, run 'make
AtomEye.app'. This application can then be copied to your Applications
folder and associated with XYZ files to allow them to be opened from
the Finder.
