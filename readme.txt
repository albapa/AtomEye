If you are a QUIP user, you should check out this module underneath
${QUIP_ROOT}/Tools, and set the QUIP_ARCH environment variable
appropriately.

Then do 'make' to make an AtomEye binary (./bin/A) or 'make
atomeyelib' to compile as a library, suitable for calling from Python.

See the 'Python' subdirectory for a Python extension module which
links to this library. Documentation for the Python interface is
available at <http://www.jrkermode.co.uk/quippy/atomeye.html>
